2 First, use SELECT * from both tables and use your knowledge of queries and aggregate functions to get to know the data:

-What are the Top 25 schools (.edu domains)?
   SELECT TOP(25) *
   FROM users
   WHERE email_domain LIKE'%.edu'

-How many .edu learners are located in New York?
   select * from users
   where city = 'New York'
-The mobile_app column contains either mobile-user or NULL. How many of these Codecademy learners are using the mobile app?
   select * from users
   where mobile_app = 'mobile-user'


3 Using this function, query for the sign up counts for each hour.


   SELECT sign_up_at,
      strftime('%H', sign_up_at)
   FROM users
   GROUP BY 1
   LIMIT 20;
   
4 Join the two tables using JOIN and then see what you can dig out of the data!

-Do different schools (.edu domains) prefer different courses?
